Energy consumption in residential areas contributes significantly to overall energy
demand. In this context, this paper presents methods to analysis, model, and forecast
energy consumption of different appliances in homes. Data used include measurements
of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather of a smart
home with IOT sensors. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove
redundant columns, and derive meaningful features. The processed data is then used
to develop various predictive models, including traditional time series models like
ARIMA and modern machine learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
networks. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean
Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and others.
